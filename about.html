  <h1>Welcome to Re:Zero Info</h1>

  <h2>An Extensive Fan Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    Re:Zero Info is a long-form, fan-made informational website dedicated to the anime
    and light novel series <strong>Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World</strong>.
    This site was created to serve as a central hub for fans who wish to explore the
    story, characters, themes, timelines, lore, and emotional depth of the Re:Zero universe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Re:Zero is not a simple isekai story. It is a psychological, emotional, and often brutal
    narrative that explores suffering, hope, despair, self-worth, sacrifice, and personal growth.
    This website exists to respect that depth and provide structured information in a calm,
    readable, and community-focused way.
  </p>

  <p>
    The protagonist, Subaru Natsuki, is suddenly transported from modern Japan into a fantasy
    world without explanation. Unlike traditional heroes, Subaru does not gain overwhelming power.
    Instead, he receives a curse known as <em>Return by Death</em>, forcing him to relive time
    whenever he dies. This mechanic shapes the entire narrative and emotional core of the series.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, Subaru encounters many characters — Emilia, Rem, Ram, Beatrice, Roswaal,
    Otto, Garfiel, and many others — each with their own motivations, traumas, and goals.
    The story does not glorify suffering, but instead forces characters to confront it.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is designed for both new viewers and long-time fans. If you are new,
    you can learn about characters and story arcs at your own pace. If you are experienced,
    you can revisit lore details, symbolism, and discussions shared by the community.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe Re:Zero is best enjoyed when discussed with others. That is why this site
    also focuses on community-building. We do not track users, we do not store personal data,
    and we do not require accounts. This introduction page simply welcomes you.
  </p>

  <p>
    The themes of Re:Zero include self-forgiveness, the danger of escapism, the weight of expectations,
    and the importance of accepting help from others. Subaru’s journey is not about becoming perfect,
    but about learning to stand up again after failure.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is continuously evolving. New pages may be added for timelines, world lore,
    witch factors, authorities, and future arcs. All content here is written with respect
    to the original creators.
